## Pymaceuticals Data Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to examine a real-world dataset from Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications. The dataset consists of the results of an animal study conducted by the company to evaluate potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer.

## Background
As a senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, Inc., I have been given access to the complete data from the company's recent animal study. The study involved 249 mice with SCC tumors who were subjected to different drug regimens. Over a period of 45 days, the development and measurement of tumor growth were recorded. The main objective of the study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, with other treatment regimens.

## Tasks
The assignment is divided into the following tasks:

Prepare the Data: This involves merging the "mouse_metadata" and "study_results" datasets into a single DataFrame, checking for duplicate mouse IDs, and creating a cleaned DataFrame without any duplicates.

Generate Summary Statistics: Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts: Generate bar charts to visualize the total number of mice/timepoints for each drug regimen and create pie charts to show the distribution of female and male mice in the study.

Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot: Calculate the final tumor volume for each mouse across four promising treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), determine potential outliers, and create a box plot to visualize the distribution of final tumor volume.

Create a Line Plot and Scatter Plot: Generate a line plot to illustrate the tumor volume over time for a mouse treated with Capomulin and create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.

Calculate Correlation and Regression: Calculate the correlation coefficient and perform linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

## Requirements
The analysis will be graded based on the following requirements:

Data Preparation: Merging datasets, identifying duplicate mouse IDs, and creating a cleaned DataFrame.
Summary Statistics: Calculating mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume for each drug regimen.
Bar Charts and Pie Charts: Creating bar charts and pie charts to visualize data.
Quartiles, Outliers, and Box Plot: Calculating quartiles, identifying outliers, and creating a box plot.
Line Plot and Scatter Plot: Generating a line plot and a scatter plot.
Correlation and Regression: Calculating correlation coefficient and performing linear regression analysis.
Submission: Including observations or inferences at the top of the notebook and providing the GitHub repository URL for grading.
Please refer to the code comments and the provided starter file for guidance throughout the analysis.
